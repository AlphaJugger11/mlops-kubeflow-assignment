Explanation of the Inputs and Outputs for the Training Component

The training component in the Kubeflow pipeline is responsible for
loading the processed data, training the machine learning model, and
saving the trained model artifacts. To enable smooth data flow and
modularity, the component defines clear inputs and outputs.

Inputs

1.  processed_data_path (Input Artifact / String Path) This input
    provides the file path to the cleaned and preprocessed dataset
    generated by the previous component (data preprocessing).
    -   Purpose: Ensures the training step always receives standardized,
        ready-to-train data.
    -   Why needed: The model should not operate on raw data.
2.  learning_rate (Parameter) A hyperparameter passed dynamically into
    the training function.
    -   Purpose: Controls how aggressively the model updates its
        weights.
    -   Why needed: Allows tuning without modifying component code.
3.  n_estimators / epochs / other hyperparameters (Optional)
    -   Purpose: Enables flexible experimentation.
    -   Why needed: Makes the training component reusable with different
        configurations.

Outputs

1.  model_output_path (Output Artifact)
    -   Purpose: Saved trained model used by evaluation or deployment
        components.
    -   Typical formats: .pkl, .pt, .h5
2.  metrics_output_path (Output Artifact)
    -   Purpose: Stores evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision,
        recall, or loss.
    -   Why needed: For MLflow logging and reporting.
